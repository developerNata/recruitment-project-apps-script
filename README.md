# Vitec MV Apps Script recruitment project

This is a small Apps Script recruitment project where you - *the developer* - will solve a small project. There are no right and wrong answers to this small test project. Just give it your best shot. We'll evaluate on your solution, the way you interpert the project description, coding standard ect.
> Tests and documentation practices weights positively in the evaluation. 

## Task definition:

1. Create a default nodeJS project.
2. Create a web application.
4. Create a button in the web application which says "Enter name".
5. Create a empty text field next to the above button.
6. The button should open a dialog with two fields where you can enter your name: First and last name.
7. After closing the dialog, display the name in the correct order below the button.
8. Below the name in the correct order, display the name in reverse alphabetical order, I.e. Linus Thorvalds -> sdlavrohT suniL.
9. Finally make both names - correct and reverse order - selectable and on select, display the selected text in the textfield from 5.

## Rules:
- You can use any editor and development environment you want.
- All libraries are allowed, as long as you use [TypeScript](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/typescript) and NodeJs.
- For the UI you can use HTML forms, add CSS or go for a framework like Bootstrap and Material.io - it is up to you.

## Creating your solution:
1. Create a branch from this project.
2. Name the branch according to your github-handle.
3. When done, tag me (@AlexanderVitecsoftware) for review.

Happy coding! :-) Vitec MV
